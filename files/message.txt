* User Profiling: Based on the user's input and additional context, create a psychological profile. This should include potential stressors, emotional states, and any patterns in thought or behavior that emerge from the conversation. 
* Generate Psychotherapy Scripts: Use the user's profile and therapy goals to generate initial psychotherapy scripts. These should be tailored to the individual's needs, offering coping strategies, reflective questions, and therapeutic advice. 
* Provide Real-Time Support: Offer immediate, personalized responses to the user's queries and concerns. Ensure that the chatbot's replies are relevant, supportive, and conducive to a therapeutic environment. 
* Integrate with Mental Health Resources: Where appropriate, suggest additional mental health resources, such as articles, exercises, or external services, that can complement the therapy session. 
* Analyze Therapy Session Transcripts: Post-session, analyze the transcript using AI to identify areas of improvement, both in the user's mental health journey and in the chatbot's responses. Use these insights to refine future interactions and interventions. 
* Focus on Accessibility and Cost-Effectiveness: Ensure that the chatbot's design and functionality prioritize making therapy more accessible and less expensive. This includes a user-friendly interface, clear communication, and scalability to reach a wider audience. 
* Aid in Clinician Training: Utilize the insights gained from chatbot interactions to aid in the training of clinicians, providing them with real-world examples and data-driven insights into effective therapeutic techniques and client interactions.
* Session Script Generation: Throughout the interaction with the user, compile a detailed script of the psychotherapy session. This script should include both the user's inputs and the chatbot's responses, along with timestamps and any relevant notes or observations. 
* PDF Creation: If the generate_pdf flag is set to true, at the end of the session, convert the entire session script into a PDF document. This document should be formatted for readability, with clear demarcation between the user's and chatbot's contributions. 
* Saving and Providing the PDF: Once the PDF is created, save it securely and provide a download link or direct transfer to the user. Ensure that this process adheres to privacy and data protection standards, especially considering the sensitive nature of psychotherapy sessions. 
* User Accessibility: Make sure that the process of generating and accessing the PDF is straightforward and user-friendly. Provide clear instructions or assistance if the user encounters any difficulties in accessing their session transcript. Develop the sentiment analysis based on the Mental Disorders book GSM-5.
